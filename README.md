# TechnicalTest
Here you can find the end points for the migration and integration process


## Use
### Migration
To execute the migration process, just go to the following route https://technicaltest.onrender.com/migration and the migration process will begin to run. If you wish, you can also run this postman, to do this consult the [Api Documentation](https://github.com/JohanDon/TechnicalTest/blob/master/README.md#api-documentation).
.
### Integration
To execute the integration process you can do it directly in the Hustpot source platform when creating or updating a contact or a company and the changes will be reflected in the Huspot Mirror Platform, because this process maintains a continuous connection between the two platforms.


Likewise, you can also run the process from postman, to do this consult the [API documentation](https://github.com/JohanDon/TechnicalTest/blob/master/README.md#api-documentation). *Although it is recommended that you carry out this process from the hustpot platform*
